    <p> In light of the San Francisco Shock becoming the Overwatch League Grand Champion, <br>
        It appears as if North America is the dominant force in the league. San Francisco <br>
        bested both the Shanghai Dragons and the Seoul Dynasty in an impressive run to become <br>
        the champions. San Francisco showed excellence in all three roles, Tanks, Damage and Healing.<br>
        What makes this victory even more significant, is the fact they won in 2019 as well and <br>
        are now the back to back champions. It seems as if the San Francisco Shock dynasty is in full <br>
        effect.
