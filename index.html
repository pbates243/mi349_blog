            In light of the San Francisco Shock becoming the Overwatch League Grand Champion, <br>
        It appears as if North America is the dominant force in the league. San Francisco <br>
        bested both the Shanghai Dragons and the Seoul Dynasty in an impressive run to become <br>
        the champions. San Francisco showed excellence in all three roles, Tanks, Damage and Healing.<br>
        What makes this victory even more significant, is the fact they won in 2019 as well and <br>
        are now the back to back champions. It seems as if the San Francisco Shock dynasty is in full <br>
        effect.

            The final match was against the Seoul Dynasty and it was indeed a thriller with a final score <br>
        of 4-2 in favor of the Shock. The Shock came out swinging and absolutely dominated on the first map <br>
        taking the early lead. After losing the first map, the Dynasty chose the next map to play. <br>
        The selection of Kings Row seemed to favor the Dynasty, but a strong defense by the Shock would prove <br>
        otherwise. The Shocks early lead would not last. The Dynasty would battle back to even up the series <br>
        at 2-2, but from there on, the Shock would show the world why they are indeed the back to back Overwatch <br> 
        League Grand Champions. The Shock would go on to win the following two matches in a grueling battle, but <br>
        their ability to adapt and overcome has been, and will be, what keeps the W's rolling in for the Shock. <br>
