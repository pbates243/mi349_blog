            In light of the San Francisco Shock becoming the Overwatch League Grand Champion, <br>
        It appears as if North America is the dominant force in the league. San Francisco <br>
        bested both the Shanghai Dragons and the Seoul Dynasty in an impressive run to become <br>
        the champions. San Francisco showed excellence in all three roles, Tanks, Damage and Healing.<br>
        What makes this victory even more significant, is the fact they won in 2019 as well and <br>
        are now the back to back champions. It seems as if the San Francisco Shock dynasty is in full <br>
        effect.

            The final match was against the Seoul Dynasty and it was indeed a thriller with a final score <br>
        of 4-2 in favor of the Shock. The Shock came out swinging and absolutely dominated on the first map <br>
        taking the early lead. After losing the first map, the Dynasty chose the next map to play. <br>
        The selection of Kings Row seemed to favor the Dynasty, but a strong defense by the Shock would prove <br>
        otherwise. The Shocks early lead would not last. The Dynasty would battle back to even up the series <br>
        at 2-2, but from there on, the Shock would show the world why they are indeed the back to back Overwatch <br> 
        League Grand Champions. The Shock would go on to win the following two matches in a grueling battle, but <br>
        their ability to adapt and overcome has been, and will be, what keeps the W's rolling in for the Shock. <br>

    <h2>
        Overwatch Meta Update
    </h2>

    <p>
        <img src="owmeta.png" alt= "Hero Pick Rate"> 
    </p>

    <h3>
        Understanding the Meta
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        The Overwatch meta is constantly shifting due to the never ending balancing done by the developers. <br>
        New heroes or new maps will always call for balance updates, but sometimes it’s not as easy as it seems<br>
        to keep things even. It was only a few weeks ago where we saw Roadhog receive a buff that made him almost <br>
        a necessity to have on your team in order to win. Thankfully those changes have been reverted and the playing <br>
        field has seemed to be leveled. <br>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Tanks
    </h3>

    <p>
        First we will break down the tanks. The tanks seem to be incredibly balanced, allowing overwatch players to pick <br>
        whatever their favorite combination is. Reinhardt and Zayra or Winston and D.V.A, or any of the synergetic tank combinations.<br>
        What we are seeing now more than ever, is playing tanks according to the map. One example of this would be playing dive tanks<br>
        on Numbani or Watchpoint Gibraltar. This is precisely what the developers goal is, map based meta. <br>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Damage
    </h3>

    <p>
        Now for damage, we haven’t seen any crazy shifts. The meta has seemed to remain true. Ashe is the best dps, but characters like Widowmaker <br>
        and Tracer are still very viable due to their high skill cieling. Genji has been up and down recently due to the current patch, but currently <br>
        he is in a good place as well. Something that has not changed at all is the fact that if your aim is good, you can play whatever you please. <br>
        This is something that will always be true. <br>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Healers
    </h3>

    <p>
        Finally we have healers. The healer meta seems to be non-existent at the moment. You really just need to play healers that compliment the rest of your team's composition.<br>
        One main healer and one off healer is still ideal, but really anything can work. <br>
