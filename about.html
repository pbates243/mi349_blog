    <h1>
        Who I am.
    </h1>
    <p>
        My name is Patrick Bates and I am a student at Michigan State University studying Media and Information. <br>
        I grew up in Ann Arbor Michigan, and went to Pioneer High School. In high school I played a variety of sports <br>
        but eventually found myself enjoying Ultimate Frisbee the most. I carried this passion with me to college and <br> 
        ended up finishing my college career on the Michigan State Mens Ultimate Frisbee Team. Some of my other hobbies <br>
        include fishing, camping, music, piano and video games. My favorite video game is Overwatch which is the stem of <br>
        my inspiration for writing my blogs
    </p>

    <h1>
        My Goals
    </h1>
    <p>
        After finishing my degree at MSU I hope to find work in the video game design field. I have enjoyed learning how to <br>
        code at MSU, and hope that I can soon find work where I can sharpen my skills. I have learned to code in variety of languages. <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Javascript</li>
            <li> Python</li>
            <li> C#</li>
            <li> C++ </li>
        </ul>
         My true expertise is with the software Unity,which is used to create video games. Blizzard (the develoepr of Overwatch) <br>
         has a variety of jobs thats use Unity, and my long term goal is to one day be a Unity Designer
